MenuAPI
-

First get the menu manager by using:
```java
DotUtilities.getMenuManager();
```

You can store the manager in a MenuManager object, or just use the `createMenu()` method and store the resulting menu. It is recommended to just create a menu, as that's the only method that's exposed.

###MenuManager
1. `createMenu() : Menu`
  * Create a new menu.

####createMenu
1. `Player player`
  * The player to create the menu for.
2. `int size`
  * The number of slots in the menu (Must be a multiple of 9).
3. `String title`
  * The title shown at the top of the menu.

* `Menu`
  * The menu created from the parameters.

Creates a new Menu object based on the parameters provided. The title will be shown above the menu. The size must be a multiple of 9. If it is not it will be corrected to the closest multiple. Note that this will likely change to a rows parameter later.



###Menu
1. `setButton() : MenuButton`
  * Create a button on the menu.
2. `showMenu() : void`
  * Show the menu to the player.
3. `getPlayer() : Player`
  * Get the player this menu is for.
4. `markDestruction() : void`
  * Remove the menu from the manager so that the GC can collect it.
5. `getExists() : boolean`
  * Check if this menu has had markDestruction() called.
6. `compareInventory() : boolean`
  * Check if an inventory is the inventory for this menu.


####setButton
1. `ItemStack item`
  * The item to display for the button.
2. `int x`
  * The x position of the button (0 based).
3. `int y`
  * The y position of the button (0 based).
4. `ButtonListener listener`
  * The ButtonListener object that should be called when the button is clicked in the menu.

* `MenuButton`
  * The button created from the parameters.

Creates a new button using the parameters and adds it to the menu in the position specified. Returns a MenuButton object with the new button.

####showMenu

Shows the current menu to the player. Note if you modify the item stack of a button while it is being shown to the player you must call this again to update the displayed items, modifications to the button listener will be updated instantly).

####getPlayer
* `Player`
  * The player that this menu was created for.

Returns the holder of this menu that was specified during it's creation.

####markDestruction

Removes this menu from the menu tracker so that it can be allowed to go out of scope for the GC to collect. Note that trying to show a menu after calling this will throw an InteralMenuException.

####compareInventory
1. `Inventory inventory`

3. `getParent() : Menu`
  * Get the menu this button is for.


####setListener
1. `ButtonListener listener`
  * The ButtonListener to call when the player clicks this button.

The buttonClicked method in the listener is called whenever the player clicks the button.
